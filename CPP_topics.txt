Basic OOPS and programming CONCEPTS

Ex:-


1. Storage classes


2. Basic usage of pointers (if students preffered choice of language is c or c++)


3. Code compilation and linking process

4. Basic OOPs concepts like classes, objects, constructor, destructors.




ALGORITHMS (Sorting, Searching)

Ex:-


1. Basic string related questions like string length and string reverse.


2. Basic sorting algos like bubblesort.
3. Time and Space complexities related questions
4. Fibonnaci of a number with and without recursion


               

               


SQL Questions

Ex:-


1. CRUD operations.
2. Difference between truncate, delete and drop

3. foreign keys, primary keys and their relationship

 

-----------------------------------------------------------------

LEVEL-2

-------------------------------------------------


OOPS and programming CONCEPTS

Ex:-
1. Questions to evaluate the understanding of students knowledge in basic programming concepts such as
inheritance (internals), interfaces, abstract classes, static polymorphism etc in detail



DataStructures & Algorithms (Sorting, Searching, Pattern matching)

Ex:-


1. Sorting algos like insertion sort, quick sort and their time complexities


2. QuickSort, Mergesort, heapsort
3. Binary search
4. Understanding of basic data structures like linkedlist(searching for a element), stacks, queue, Binary Trees and their traversals


5. Strings related questions such as (searching substring)
6. Understanding of Maps, sets( c & c++) treeset, hashset, etc in (Java).



SQL Questions

Ex:-
1. SQL Queries
2. Questions related to Database Normalisation


3. Types of Joins 

 

BASIC Operating system conceptual questions

Ex:-


1. Difference between process and threads


2. what is deadlock and how to avoid it.


3. cpu scheduling algos (FCFC, Roundrobin etc)

 

Questions to analyze logical thinking ability

LEVEL-3

------------------------------------------------------------


DataStructures related Questions 

Ex:-


1. Linkedlist related Questions (deletion of node and entire list, reversing a linked list,check if there exists a loop, length of loop)


2. Basic Implementation of Queue, Stack and their applications


3. Strings related questions such that finding a substring in given string and its optimisation


4. Questions related to double dimensional arrays.
